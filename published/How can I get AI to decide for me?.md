I'm tired of deciding to be better. I want AI to be deciding to be better. I've tried some AI tools like GPT, but they keep forgetting my preferences and context, making me repeat myself over and over.

I'm looking for a tech solution that can remember my context and preferences, and make decisions for me. Do you know any AI tools or methods that can do that?
