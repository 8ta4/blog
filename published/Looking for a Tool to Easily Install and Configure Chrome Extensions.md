I'm working on a project to create a tool that makes it easy to install and configure Chrome extensions from the command line. The idea is to let users install an extension using its ID and set it up using a JavaScript file. You can check out what I've done so far on [GitHub](https://github.com/8ta4/extension). I haven’t started coding yet because I don’t want to reinvent the wheel if there’s already a tool that solves this problem.At first, I was pretty sure there was a Chrome extension for that, but then I realized it'd be like a Chrome inception. So, I came up with my own plan:
1. Make a preferences file to install the Chrome extension as explained in the [Chrome Extensions documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/external_extensions/#preference-mac).
2. Use AppleScript to open the Chrome extension page and the JavaScript console.
3. Call the `chrome.management.setEnabled` method (as shown [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/management/#method-setEnabled)) to turn the extension on.
4. Use AppleScript again to open the Chrome extension's `manifest.json` page and the JavaScript console.
5. Run the `chrome.storage.sync.set` method and other needed methods (as described [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/#usage)) to set configuration values.But before I go any further, I want to make sure there isn't already a tool out there that does this.If you know of any existing tools or have any suggestions for a better approach, I'd love to hear from you!
