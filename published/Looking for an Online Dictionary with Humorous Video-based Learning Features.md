I'm on a fun quest for an online dictionary that's not just brain food, but also a source of laughter. Here's the scoop:

- Fun videos for each word or phrase.
- A 'like' button for each video.
- The most liked videos taking center stage.
- Comprehensive coverage of words and phrases.
- Videos that begin just before the word or phrase is used to provide context, while still maintaining the humor.

For instance, this [video](https://youtu.be/iGAMbNKcN1U?t=14) could be a match for 'Front' or 'Hand'.

I tried posing this question on WordReference.com, but alas, I got banned. Their exact words were, "You have been banned for the following reason: Spam."

Iâ€™m aware of Urban Dictionary, but it's text-based. So, my fellow language enthusiasts, do you know of any other dictionaries that could make learning a laughing matter?
