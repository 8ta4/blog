I'm working on a live streaming project where I code but don't speak. To make my streams more engaging, I'm considering using a Language Learning Model (LLM) to generate commentary on my coding, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) to vocalize it. Some people find my stream helpful for curing insomnia, but I want to reach a wider audience.

Is there an existing tool or service that combines LLM and TTS? Any suggestions on how best to implement this?
