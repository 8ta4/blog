When I search on Google or other search engines, I want to be able to navigate the search results using numeric keys `1-9`. For example, if I hit `1`, I want to navigate to the first result; if I hit `2`, I want to navigate to the second result, and so on.

I've tried extensions like Vimium and even considered writing a custom userscript with Tampermonkey, but these options didn't quite meet my needs. It seems like every time I master keyboard shortcuts for one app, another one comes along - it's like playing cat and mouse!

Is there any existing application or extension that provides this functionality, or any other suggestions to achieve this?
