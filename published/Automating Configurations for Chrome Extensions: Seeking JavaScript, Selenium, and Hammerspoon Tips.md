I love using Chrome extensions like Video Speed Controller and Vimium to boost my productivity to do more important things, like watching cat videos. But I don't like having to manually adjust their settings.

I want to automate this process by opening the extensions' settings pages and running JavaScript to set their preferences. I tried AppleScript, but due to changes in Chrome's policy on JavaScript injection via AppleScript, this approach is no longer viable.

I'm thinking of using Selenium and Hammerspoon, but I'm not sure how to do it right.

Does anyone have experience with automating Chrome extensions using JavaScript, Selenium, or Hammerspoon? I would love to hear your tips, feedback, or suggestions. Or if you know any other tools that can help me with this, please let me know.
