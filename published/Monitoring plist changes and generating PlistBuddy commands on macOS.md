I recently posted a question on /r/mac about monitoring plist changes and generating PlistBuddy commands on macOS. I'm seeking additional input from the /r/macos community. Here's the original question:

I'm trying to monitor changes in plist files on macOS and generate corresponding PlistBuddy commands for those changes. I'd like to know if there's an efficient way to achieve this, or if there are any tools or methods that can help me accomplish this task. Any suggestions or insights would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your help!

By the way, PlistBuddy? More like "Pissed Buddy" when dealing with those pesky plist files, am I right?
