Hi r/LanguageTechnology,

I'm searching for a tool, method, or browser extension that leverages natural language processing (NLP) to automatically turn prose on webpages into a sequence of questions and answers. I find text written in this Q&A style engaging, and I believe it could be a useful way to digest online content.

Some books like Quick Calculus and Little Schemer use a similar style based on programmed learning (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_learning). While I understand that this approach has its limitations, I think the Q&A style could still provide value, particularly if powered by NLP techniques.

I've experimented with manually copying and pasting text into large language models (LLMs) to generate questions and answers, but this method has several drawbacks:

- Manual copy and pasting is tedious.
- There is a token limit.
- Some generated questions are not relevant or useful.
- The output is difficult to read due to loss of original formatting.
- There may be hallucinations.

My ideal tool or NLP-based solution would:

- Be easy to install and use (possibly as a browser extension).
- Work with a simple click or keyboard shortcut.
- Not have a token limit.
- Automatically generate meaningful questions.
- Insert each question just before the corresponding answer.
- Retain the look and feel of the original webpage.
- Use the existing prose in the answers.

It isn't perfect, though. Skips right over videos. Not that it's a problem, given my video search history is questionable to begin with. You know what I mean.

Does anyone have any suggestions or know of existing NLP-powered tools or methods that could achieve this? Your help is greatly appreciated!
