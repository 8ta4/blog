I'm using DuckDuckGo and I'm loving its !bang feature. DuckDuckGo bangs are shortcuts that let you search directly on other websites. Google? That's `!g`. Wikipedia? That's `!w`. Tinder? That's swipe right and hope for a bang.

The only problem is, I sometimes forget to use the !bangs or I don't know which ones are available for the websites I visit. Does anyone know of a solution that would remind me or make me aware of the available !bangs when I'm on a website that has them?
