Here’s what I need:
1. A tool that can mark a post as an example of a problem my product can solve. 2. This tool should then diligently monitor new posts, scoring them based on their similarity to the examples I've provided. 3. When it finds a match, it should notify me so I can engage with the post.

Is there an existing tool that can do this?

I’ve developed a similar tool for Reddit. This tool, equipped with the power of natural language processing and machine learning, was designed to monitor posts and alert me when it found discussions about problems my product could solve so that I could earn karma, awards, and gold.

But Reddit’s strike taught some of us a valuable lesson. We learned that there is more to life than karma, awards, and gold. Reddit's strike also taught some of us a harsh lesson. We learned that there is nothing more to life than karma, awards, and gold.

Hacker News seems like a more promising place.
