I'm thinking of building [a command-line tool](https://github.com/8ta4/pun) that generates puns based on text input. There are plenty of pun generators out there, but I've got some reasons for making yet another one:

- Most pun generators I've seen are web-based. But, for my workflow, a simple CLI tool is just faster.

- Some tools generate puns based on obscure terms. I'm aiming for things people would generally understand and hopefully find at least mildly amusing.

- Context is King or Queen. Most existing tools I've found don't generate puns relevant to the specific text you give them.

I haven't dived into writing production-level code yet.

When I posted about this before, u/thepartners mentioned their tool [idealy](https://idealy.app), which isn't CLI. But it still gave me loads of inspiration.

Are there any features you'd want in a tool like this? I'd love to get your take on the concept.
