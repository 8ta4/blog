I'm searching for a tool or library that can help me search for acronyms in general and find their alternative funny meanings.

For example, the tool should be able to recognize "BBC" as an acronym and suggest a funny meaning like "Big Black Cock" (as mentioned in this [video](https://youtu.be/OUO4D2RWnL4?t=28)).

Here's a quote from the video as an example:

```
BBC's British-born Chinese, by the way. It's not Big Black Cock, all right?
```

Is there an existing tool, API, or library that can help me achieve this?
