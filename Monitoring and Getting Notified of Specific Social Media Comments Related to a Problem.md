I am looking for a way to monitor social media comments that discuss a specific problem my product solves. I have tried Google Alerts, but the noise-to-signal ratio is too high. How can I get notified of relevant comments on platforms like Reddit with better accuracy and less noise? Are there any APIs, tools, or techniques that can help me achieve this?

I'm desperate to save the world from the chaos caused by unresolved problems or at least get some extra social media followers, whichever comes first.
