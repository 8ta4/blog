I recently posted a similar question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76240520/monitoring-and-getting-notified-of-specific-social-media-comments-related-to-a-p) regarding monitoring social media comments related to a specific problem my product solves. The main motivation for this is that when I see old social media comments about a problem my product solves, I wish I could go back in time and sell my product to those users. What I've learned is that this is an NP-hard problem known as the time-traveling salesman problem. However, I'm now focusing on finding APIs, tools, and techniques that can help me monitor and get notified of relevant comments with better accuracy and less noise in real-time.
