I frequently find myself caught in an analysis paralysis loop, even when it comes to seemingly simple decisions like picking out fruits at the grocery store. I spend so much time that I eventually go bananas.I've tried using AI tools like GPT to assist in decision-making. However, these tools seem to have a hard time retaining my context or preferences.Do you have any effective strategies to overcome analysis paralysis? Ideally, I'm looking for solutions that can remember the context and preferences to streamline the decision-making process.
