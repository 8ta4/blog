Is there a service that can automatically publish my emails with customer service, hiding all the personal info?

Here's what I need:

- Automatic Redaction: It would automatically remove any sensitive stuff like account numbers and personal details.

- Public Publishing: It would publish the emails somewhere public, so other people could read them.

- Ease of Use: I could just CC a special email address when I'm emailing a company, and it would handle the rest.

I think this could be useful for a couple of reasons:

- Aid in Knowledge Sharing: It would help people find answers to common problems, so they wouldn't have to keep bugging customer service about the same things.

- Encourage Better Customer Service: It might make companies step up their customer service game since they'd know their responses could end up public.

Sharing is scaring.

I recently had this thing happen with Hacker News. That's what got me wondering if there's a service that could handle this kind of thing.

Here's the email:

> Your account's not banned, but HN's software is killing your posts because it thinks you're running afoul of the rule against using the site primarily for promotionâ€”see [REDACTED]: "Please don't use HN primarily for promotion. It's ok to submit your own stuff part of the time, but the primary use of the site should be for curiosity." Our software detects that sort of submission history and starts filtering the posts once the percentage of own-posts is too high.

> On HN, the idea is for people to submit stories that they ran across and personally found intellectually interesting, not because they have something to promote. It's fine to post your own work, as long as it's interspersed with interesting posts from unrelated sources. But when an account submits promotionally, it feels like they're not participating as a community member, and HN users notice this and flag the posts.

> It's best to build up a track record of interesting submissions from unrelated sources, and to intersperse your own articles with those. The software considers submission histories adaptively, so if you do that, your own-posts will eventually stop getting filtered.

> If you dig up interesting things from a variety of places, things people haven't run into before, then you'll be perceived as a community contributor rather than someone trying to market something. Particularly good are stories on out-of-the-way topics that rarely or never get attention. The best submissions are the ones that can't be predicted from any existing sequence.

> (Note: avoid posting major sites like youtube, twitter, medium, etc., for this purpose, because the software classifies them alongside the promotional posts so they won't help 'dig you out'. Ditto for Show HNs and Ask HNs (text posts) - avoid those until you're in the clear.)
