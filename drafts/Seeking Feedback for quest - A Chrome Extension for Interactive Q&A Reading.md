I'm currently in the design phase of a Chrome extension called `quest`. The goal is to revolutionize how users consume technical content by transforming it into a Q&A journey - akin to a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book, but with questions. This project is still in its early stages, and I haven't started coding yet. However, I have a design rationale, which you can find [here](https://github.com/8ta4/quest/blob/main/docs/RATIONALE.md).

Some features of `quest` include:

- **Universality**: Theoretically, it can morph any content into questions using generative AI.
- **Non-Linear Reading**: Users can hop around sections while `quest` keeps track of their progress.
- **Interactivity**: `quest` throws a question, hides the answer, and lets users gauge their understanding.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Navigation is possible solely using keyboard shortcuts.

I underline every sentence in my book. With my Asperger's, they said I couldn't "read between the lines". This is why I created `quest`, to help others like me navigate the world of technical content.

Before I proceed further, I'm seeking your valuable insights on two fronts:

1. If there are any existing alternatives that serve a similar purpose, I'd like to know so I can avoid duplicating efforts.
2. I'd appreciate any feedback regarding the design or implementation. If there's a better way to achieve my goal, I want to know.
