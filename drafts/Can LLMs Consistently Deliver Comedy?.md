How can I consistently create humor using LLMs?

I'm diving deep into how I can get Large Language Models (LLMs) to crack jokes consistently. Here's where I'm at:

1. Black Comedy: I started off trying to get LLMs to push the envelope with some edgy humor using an uncensored model. However, these models often fell short of generating coherent text compared to censored models. This limitation led me to set aside this approach, which I talked about in [a Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1c3e85q/seeking_an_uncensored_capable_language_model_for/).

1. Wordplay: Next, I tried making jokes out of cliches and phrases. This method owes a lot to "[Comedy Writing for Late-Night TV](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22350931)". It's hit or miss, and picking the good stuff takes a lot of work. You can read more about it in [my guide](https://github.com/8ta4/gag/blob/dc2d14dd05a0c0c200afcc6fbced38fc176f99b6/README.md). My goal isn't to create the best jokes in the world but to reliably churn out decent ones, kind of like what you'd hear on late-night TV daily. Here's a joke from Late Night with Jimmy Fallon that showcases the level of humor I'm aiming for: "An airline in Sweden plans to host the first-ever in-flight gay wedding in December. The entire flight crew is excited for the event, although the right wing isn't happy about it."

I appreciate any suggestions!
