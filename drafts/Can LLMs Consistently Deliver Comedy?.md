How can I consistently create humor using Large Language Models (LLMs)?

Here's where I'm at:

1. Black Comedy: I started off trying to get LLMs to push the envelope with some edgy humor using an uncensored model.

   Unfortunately, they struggled to produce coherent text compared to censored models. This limitation led me to shelve this approach, which I talked about in [a Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1c3e85q/seeking_an_uncensored_capable_language_model_for).

1. Wordplay: Next, I tried making jokes out of cliches and phrases. This method owes a lot to "[Comedy Writing for Late-Night TV](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22350931)". My goal isn't to create the best jokes in the world but to churn out decent ones, kind of like what you'd hear on late-night TV daily. Here's a joke from Late Night with Jimmy Fallon that showcases the level of humor I'm aiming for: "An airline in Sweden plans to host the first-ever in-flight gay wedding in December. The entire flight crew is excited for the event, although the right wing isn't happy about it." You can dive deeper into my process in [my guide](https://github.com/8ta4/gag/blob/dc2d14dd05a0c0c200afcc6fbced38fc176f99b6/README.md).

   However, this approach can be hit or miss, and filtering out the duds is a chore.

   I'm thinking about automating the screening process of these jokes by funneling one prompt's output into another and managing the workflow with APIs.

   This could streamline things but also lock me into a rigid system. Plus, there's a risk of becoming obsolete quickly with new models or better joke-making techniques popping up.

I'd value any alternative approaches or tweaks to my strategies. All suggestions are welcome!

The content above was [something I posted](https://old.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1cjnw4l/can_llms_consistently_deliver_comedy) on [r/Standup](https://old.reddit.com/r/Standup) first, but it got taken down. I'm pretty sure it's because they didn't like the whole machine learning and comedy angle, which can be touchy for folks who do comedy the traditional way. So, I figured I'd bring it over here instead, where folks might dig into the tech side of things more and give me some solid feedback on how to make these machine-generated jokes sharper.
