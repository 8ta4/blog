How can I consistently create humor using LLMs?

I'm diving deep into how I can get Large Language Models (LLMs) to crack jokes consistently. Here's where I'm at:

1. Black Comedy: I started off trying to get AI to push the envelope with some edgy humor using an uncensored model. However, these models often fell short on generating coherent text compared to censored models. This limitation led me to set aside this approach, which I talked about in a Reddit post.

1. Wordplay: Next, I tried making jokes out of cliches and phrases. This method owes a lot to Joe Toplyn's "Comedy Writing for Late-Night TV." It's hit or miss, and picking the good stuff takes a lot of work. You can read more about it in my guide.

Here's what might make you skeptical:

- Subjectivity of Humor: While humor is subjective, if the evaluation process consistently replicates a specific human preference using LLMs, it addresses this challenge.

- Creativity in Humor: Some folks think LLMs and creativity are a tough mix. Yet, my goal isn't to create the best jokes in the world but to reliably churn out decent ones, kind of like what you'd hear on late-night TV daily. This could suggest a more formulaic approach to joke generation is viable.

Here's a joke from Late Night with Jimmy Fallon that showcases the level of humor I'm aiming for: "An airline in Sweden plans to host the first-ever in-flight gay wedding in December. The entire flight crew is excited for the event, although the right wing isn't happy about it."

I appreciate any suggestions!
