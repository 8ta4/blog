I'm on the hunt for a voice transcription tool that can operate continuously, in real-time, 24/7, to enhance my workflow. I need something that doesn't require constant starting and stopping.

I've looked into a few options, but none of them seem to provide the non-stop, real-time transcription I'm after:

- Siri/Google Assistant: They're great for short dictations, but they don't offer continuous transcription.
- Otter.ai: This tool provides real-time transcription for meetings and interviews, but using it 24/7 could get expensive.
- Rev Voice Recorder: It lacks real-time capabilities and needs to be manually activated.

Before I decide to build or modify a tool myself, I thought I'd ask here:

Does anyone know of a tool that can provide 24/7 transcription?

I've started sketching out some initial ideas here:

But my main goal is to find out if such a tool already exists so I don't end up reinventing the wheel.
