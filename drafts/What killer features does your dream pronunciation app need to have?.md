What features would you want in your ideal pronunciation grading app?

A while back, I asked if anyone knew of a pronunciation grading app that could provide feedback on how close you are to a target accent. I didn't find what I was looking for, so I thought, "Why not build it myself?"

I got this suggestion from u/Antoine-Antoinette in that thread. They said the app should let you evaluate multi-word phrases and sentences without having to pause or hit any keys between words. So I implemented it to encourage more natural pronunciation flow. They also mentioned that they were using Google Translate for pronunciation practice as a DIY solution, which got me thinking.

I decided to compare how well different speech recognition providers perform, including Google's offering. I felt like Deepgram was more accurate than Google Translate. Plus, I found some independent benchmarks that suggested Google's speech-to-text has a pretty high word error rate compared to some of its competitors. That's why my app is using Deepgram for speech recognition.

At first, I was planning to make it a web app so it'd be easy for everyone to access. But I ended up making a standalone desktop version for Mac because I was lazy. Now, the current tool does require a bit of technical knowledge to run, but it's at a point where it could be useful for learners who want to refine their pronunciation if they are comfortable with technology. I wanted to share this update to wrap up the previous discussion and let you all know that this tool is out there.

So, my accent asked me, "What do you hope to achieve with this app?" I said, "I want to perfect my accent so there's no room for misinterpretation when I say, 'You're fired.'"

Anyway, if you have any other suggestions, I'm all ears.
