I have a specific need that I'm hoping to find a solution for. I'm using an Apple Silicon Mac and Google Chrome to browse the web. When I perform a search on Google or other search engines, I want to be able to navigate the search results using numeric keys `1-9`. 

For example, if I hit `1`, I want to navigate to the first result; if I hit `2`, I want to navigate to the second result, and so on. 

I've looked into extensions like Vimium and also considered writing a custom userscript with Tampermonkey, but neither of these options quite meet my needs. Vimium doesn't strictly follow the order of search results, and writing a custom userscript could be more complex and may not work perfectly with every website.

Is there any existing application or extension that provides this functionality, or any other suggestions to achieve this?
