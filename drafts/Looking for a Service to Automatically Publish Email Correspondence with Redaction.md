I'm looking for a service that can help automate the publication of my email correspondence with customer service providers. Here's what I need:

- Automatic Redaction: The service should automatically redact sensitive information such as personal details, account numbers, etc.

- Public Publishing: Once redacted, the emails should be automatically published to a public platform where others can view the correspondence.

- Ease of Use: Ideally, I want to include a specific email address in the CC field when contacting a service provider, and the rest of the process should be automated.

The goal is multifaceted:

- Encourage better customer service: By making interactions public, service providers may be more motivated to provide better customer service.

- Increase Accountability: Public records can hold service providers accountable for their actions.

- Aid in Knowledge Sharing: Publicly available correspondence can help others find answers to similar issues, reducing the need for repeated customer service interactions.
