I'm looking for a service that can help automate the publication of my email correspondence with customer service providers. Here's what I need:

- Automatic Redaction: The service should automatically redact sensitive information such as personal details, account numbers, etc.

- Public Publishing: Once redacted, the emails should be automatically published to a public platform where others can view the correspondence.

- Ease of Use: Ideally, I want to include a specific email address in the CC field when contacting a service provider, and the rest of the process should be automated.

The goal is multifaceted:

- Aid in Knowledge Sharing: Publicly available correspondence can help others find answers to similar issues, reducing the need for repeated customer service interactions.

- Encourage Better Customer Service: By making interactions public, service providers may be more motivated to provide better customer service.

Sharing is scaring.

I recently had a run-in with Hacker News. I got an email that I thought was worth sharing. That got me thinking if there’s a service for that.

Here's the email:

> I am writing to seek assistance with an issue on Hacker News. It appears that my posts are not visible to other users, and this has happened on multiple occasions. This lack of visibility leads me to believe that my account may be shadow banned or that my posts are being flagged as spam.
>
> Could you please provide some guidance on why this might be happening?
>
> Here are the links to the posts in question:
> [REDACTED]
> [REDACTED]

> Your account's not banned, but HN's software is killing your posts because it thinks you're running afoul of the rule against using the site primarily for promotion—see [REDACTED]: "Please don't use HN primarily for promotion. It's ok to submit your own stuff part of the time, but the primary use of the site should be for curiosity." Our software detects that sort of submission history and starts filtering the posts once the percentage of own-posts is too high.

> Below, I'll copy an explanation that we've sent to other users in this situation. I hope it helps explain things a bit!

> [REDACTED] (moderator)

> On HN, the idea is for people to submit stories that they ran across and personally found intellectually interesting, not because they have something to promote. It's fine to post your own work, as long as it's interspersed with interesting posts from unrelated sources. But when an account submits promotionally, it feels like they're not participating as a community member, and HN users notice this and flag the posts.
>
> It's best to build up a track record of interesting submissions from unrelated sources, and to intersperse your own articles with those. The software considers submission histories adaptively, so if you do that, your own-posts will eventually stop getting filtered.
>
> If you dig up interesting things from a variety of places, things people haven't run into before, then you'll be perceived as a community contributor rather than someone trying to market something. Particularly good are stories on out-of-the-way topics that rarely or never get attention. The best submissions are the ones that can't be predicted from any existing sequence.
>
> (Note: avoid posting major sites like youtube, twitter, medium, etc., for this purpose, because the software classifies them alongside the promotional posts so they won't help 'dig you out'. Ditto for Show HNs and Ask HNs (text posts) - avoid those until you're in the clear.)
