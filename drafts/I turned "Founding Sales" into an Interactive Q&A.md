I turned "Founding Sales" into an Interactive Q&A

I've been reading the book [Founding Sales](). I decided to turn the first chapter into an interactive Q&A format using a Chrome extension I built. This extension will prompt you with yes/no questions as you read the actual textâ€”revealing the answers only after you answer.

Here's a sample of the Q&A style:

> Q: Is modern sales about selling snake oil?

> A: No, because modern sales is actually about selling your soul to the corporate devil!

Okay, maybe that last part isn't in the original text, but you get the idea.

If you'd like to see it in action, you can:

- Install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store]()

- Check out my GitHub for more details: [GitHub Link]()

- Jump straight into the first chapter of Founding Sales with this interactive link: [Chapter 1 Interactive Q&A]()

I've only made questions for the first chapter so far, but if anyone's interested, I'm happy to create more. Let me know if you'd like to read Founding Sales this way or if you have any questions about how it works!
