I am currently using DuckDuckGo as my main search engine on a Mac with Apple Silicon, and I am a big fan of its !bang feature. For those who might not be familiar, DuckDuckGo bangs are shortcuts that allow you to directly search on other websites. For example, typing `!w pizza` will take you directly to the Wikipedia page for pizza.

My challenge is, I often forget to use the !bangs or I'm not aware of the available !bangs for the websites I visit. I'm looking for a solution that would notify me or make me aware of the available !bangs when I visit a website that has them. 

I've tried looking for browser extensions or other tools that might do this, but so far, I haven't found anything. I'd appreciate it if anyone could suggest an existing solution or even a workaround that could help. 

I'm open to any ideas or suggestions. Also, if there's a way to customize the notifications or make them more intuitive, that would be great.
