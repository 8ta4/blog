I'm working on a voice transcription tool and I wrote a software design document. It's all text, no diagrams. It covers the technical architecture and functionality.

- Where can I share it to get some helpful feedback?

- How can I avoid sounding like I'm just promoting my work?

I'm all for constructive feedback, but the internet's version of "constructive" can sometimes feel like a sledgehammer to the ego.
