I used my tool to evaluate someone's accent, which sparked [discussions](https://old.reddit.com/r/JudgeMyAccent/comments/1djc4u4/judge_my_accent_18_years_of_informal_training). u/DancesWithDawgz slid into my DMs with some feedback about the accent evaluation and questions about ways to keep their grammar in check while speaking. I figured this chat could be helpful for everyone, so here's a rundown.

First up, let's talk accent evaluation. There are two tools you might want to check out:

1. [Pronounce](https://www.getpronounce.com): This bad boy gives you phoneme-level feedback for individual words, for American English. For full sentences, it'll give you word-level feedback.

2. [`accent`](https://github.com/8ta4/accent): Now, this is my baby. It looks at both individual words and full sentences, spots any mispronounced words, and even gives you a score on how close you are to the target accent. Right now, it's set up for British English, but I could tweak it for American English or other languages. You need to be a bit tech-savvy to get it up and running.

I used to be shy because of my accent. Then I started using my tool and found my voice. People used to wish for subtitles when I spoke. Now they're begging for a mute button!

For grammar, I've cooked up this tool called [`say`](https://github.com/8ta4/say). It listens to everything you say all day and uses [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) to check if it's correct. Right now it only works for English, but I could probably make it work for other languages.
