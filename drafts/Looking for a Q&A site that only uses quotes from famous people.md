Do you know a site where you can ask questions and get answers only in the form of quotes from famous people?

I don't like the existing sites because:
- Stack Exchange: Too factual, not enough opinions
- Quora: Too much self-promotion

What I want is a site that has these features:
- Every answer is a direct quote from someone notable (people who have their own Wikipedia page)
- Every quote has a source (book title and page number, or article link with text highlight)
- Users can vote on answers

Is there such a site out there?
