Why would you want to transcribe everything you say 24/7? I'm thinking about making a video to spread the word, but first, I want your input. To kick off the discussion, I'll share my insights from using [the open-source tool](https://github.com/8ta4/say) I made since last year. Whether you've used similar approaches or this is the first you're hearing of it, your ideas are welcome. If you can think of any other potential advantages, I'm all ears!

- Memory: I speak my mind anytime, anywhere, and bam! I whisper my genius ideas in the pitch-black night without fumbling for a pen.

- To-Dos: Say goodbye to manually creating to-do lists. I just go about my day, and whenever a task pops into my head, I blurt it out.

- Meetings: Forget taking notes. I focus on the discussion.

- Journaling: It's like writing your best-selling autobiography in real time!

- Dream Journaling: Just say it. Don't let your dreams be dreams. I start talking about my dreams the second I wake up. The next step is to learn to sleep talk so I can transcribe my dreams live. That would be my dream dream journaling.

- Coffee: It's like caffeine without the coffee breath. As soon as I start moving my mouth, my brain starts spinning.

- Workaholic: I don't work from home. I work from bed. I start working the second I wake up and keep going until I pass out. If I master the art of sleep-talking, I could literally be making money while I sleep.

- Insomnia: It cured my insomnia. Instead of tossing and turning for hours on end, I speak my worries and then let them go.

- Typing: Goodbye typing strain! Voice input is the best we've got until we have direct brain-to-computer interfaces.

- Mobility: Walk the talk. You're not chained to your desk. Sitting kills.

- Exercise: My voice is my workout buddy. I turn gym time into a brainstorming session.

- Hydration: I'm drinking more water. All this talking makes me thirsty.

- Diet: Join the transcription diet! The more you transcribe, the less you eat! You can't do both at once. I'm down to one meal a day now. I lost a lot of pounds but saved even more.

- Addictions: My voice is my temple. To protect it, I've given up alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. Transcription is the ultimate rehab program.

- Grammar: Unleash your inner grammar Nazi. My transcript is automatically reviewed by [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/).

- Vocabulary: Utilizing large language models transmutes jejune transcripts into preeminent grandiloquence, as manifested in this perspicuous exemplification.

- Pronunciation: I'm not trying to impress anyone. I'm doing it for the transcription API. I want to make sure I'm saying everything just right. I never thought I'd become a phonetics nerd.

- Drafting: Write like you talk. I just say what's on my mind and refine it later.

- Voice: Bye-bye, vocal strain! Talking all the time has made my voice stronger.

- Humor: The joke is on the dinosaurs. [These fossilized comedians think humor is something only humans can do](https://old.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1cjnw4l/can_llms_consistently_deliver_comedy/). I fed their insults right back into the large language models as fuel to generate more laughs.

- Venting: When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Whenever I need to get something off my chest, I just start talking. And hey, when life gives you melons, it's just a transcription error!

- ADHD: Seeing is believing. The fact that you're reading this list shows I've managed my ADHD. I used to quit after the second item.

- Mindfulness: Wherever you go, there you speak. I've started appreciating the little things in life.

- Therapy: Time is money. Therapists charge by the hour. So, to save some precious minutes, I started sending my therapist updates generated from my transcripts using large language models. But wait, I've got these models available all the time. So, I fired my therapist.

- Observer Effect: My transcripts are my moral compass. The awareness of being constantly transcribed feels like God is watching us. I had premeditated murder, but I've stopped because my transcripts could be used as evidence against me in court.

- Procrastination: The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single word. Talking about a daunting task is my way to get the ball rolling.

- Office Politics: Work smarter, not harder. I create this illusion of productivity by turning my transcriptions into impressive reports. My boss thinks I'm always grinding.

- Decision-Making: Don't make me think. I shove my choices into a large language model and take whatever it spits out. It's a glorified coin flip.

- Programming: Rubber duck debugging is my secret weapon. By the time I actually start coding, I've already ironed out most of the issues just by talking it out.

- Media Consumption: I'm a perpetual commentator. I'm constantly commenting as I watch.

- Curiosity: Large language models are the parents I wish I had. I've rediscovered the curiosity of a child who never stops asking "why."

- Gigabit: I got Gigabit internet. Not only do I get instant transcriptions, but I can also enjoy HD cat videos.

- Audio: I've [bought more mics than I'll ever need](https://old.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedSelf/comments/19a4zf3/looking_for_a_showerproof_noisecancelling_mic_for/).

- Chores: I fired my housekeeper. Now, every chore is a chance to create transcripts.

- Briefing: Welcome to the one-person writers' room. Gone are the days when only late-night hosts could benefit from a team of content creators. Before any meeting, I spend the week leading up to it talking out loud about what I want to discuss.

- Icebreaker: I'm the life of the party. When I walk into a room with my headset on, everyone wants to know why. That's when I get to show off my quantified self project.

- Personal Space: People avoid me. If you want more personal space on a crowded subway, this tool is your secret weapon. I guess the next step is to get an [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/) and watch even more people steer clear!

- Digital Clone: Digital clones are the future. But they need more than just code. They need our thoughts. I'm preserving my transcripts in preparation for the day. You may say I'm a dreamer. But I'm not the only one.

- Companionship: Stay single forever. Imagine these large language models having my whole life story. They'd understand me on a level no human ever could. I live alone so my transcription stays uncontaminated. And if I ever got pregnant, which I never will, I'd get an abortion.
