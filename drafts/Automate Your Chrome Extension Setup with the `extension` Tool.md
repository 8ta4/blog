Here's what this tool does:

- Installs browser extensions.

- Supports JavaScript-based configuration files to set custom preferences.

With `extension`, you can script your browser environment to install and customize the extensions you need.

It's built for Chrome, but by extension, it also works with Edge and [Arc](https://arc.net) since they're Chromium-based. (No pun extended.)

[Setup and usage instructions](https://github.com/8ta4/extension) are on GitHub. It's free, open-source, and currently for macOS only. Let me know if you have feedback or ideas!
