I'm on the hunt for a to-do management tool that ticks all my boxes. Here's what I'm looking for:

- A Mac app
- NeoVim text editing
- Ergonomic keybinding for non-text editing tasks
- Local file storage for offline access
- Recurring tasks that auto-reschedule when marked done
- Due dates and start dates
- A keyboard-navigable calendar view
- Multi-line notes for each task
- Keyboard-only operation
- Low latency

I've tried a few popular tools, but they just didn't cut it:

- Todoist: No NeoVim keybinding and no local file storage
- Joplin: No NeoVim keybinding
- Taskwarrior: No multi-line notes and recurring tasks spawn new tasks
- Emacs Org-mode: Too many keystrokes and occasional performance hiccups
- NeoVim Org-mode: Even more sluggish performance
- Todo.txt: No NeoVim keybinding

If you know of a tool that fits the bill or comes close, I'd love to hear about it! üôè
