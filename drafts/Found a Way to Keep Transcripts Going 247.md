Last year, I hit up r/speechrecognition asking if anyone knew of a tool for continuous transcription. I didn't find anything that clicked, so I built [one](https://github.com/8ta4/say) myself. It runs continuously in the background with nearly sub-second latency. I only noticed later that u/HaroldYardley had messaged me looking for the same thing. If one person's asking, maybe more folks could use something like this. Since r/speechrecognition is pretty much a ghost town these days, so I'm sharing this here.

Here's what you can expect if you decide to try it out:

- It works exclusively on macOS with an Apple Silicon chip.
- Installation can be tricky.
- They say, "Create something to scratch your own itch." Well, I did and haven't stopped scratching since thanks to all the bugs.

If you're cool with these quirks, you can check out more details.

I don't check direct messages regularly, so if you have questions or feedback, feel free to post them here in this thread.
