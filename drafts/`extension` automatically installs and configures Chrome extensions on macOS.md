About a year ago, I cooked up this tool called `extension`. It's like dot files for Chrome and Edge on macOS. The idea came from a nightmare scenario: imagine losing access to both your computer and Google account simultaneously. Poof! There goes your entire Chrome setup. And let me tell you, my Chrome wasn't built in a day! I'd love to hear what you think and see how it might be useful.
