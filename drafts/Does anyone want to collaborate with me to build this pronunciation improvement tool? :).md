Hey everyone,

Just want to share a desktop application I started building, called `accent`. The goal is to leverage STT and TTS to help users improve their pronunciation by identifying mispronunciations.

Wonder if someone would be interested to help me improve this tool? I have a lot of ideas to enhance it. For example, we could create a web version so that more people can try it without installing it on their computers.

What are your thoughts about this project?

Have a good day :)

I straight-up stole this post's format from [another language learning tool post](https://old.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1f0tcpk/does_anyone_want_to_collaborate_with_me_to_build/) I spotted earlier. Two users, u/Jake_Bluuse and u/Business_Society_333, showed interest in that project. So I figured, if they're into collaborating on language apps, maybe they or other cool folks like them might want to join forces on this pronunciation tool too. If collaborating isn't your thing, you can still use the app to pronounce "no thanks" perfectly!
