Hi!

I've been working on software that helps you practice pronunciation in various languages and dialects, and I've been using it myself for the past couple of months. There were multiple similar platforms like this, but I found them lacking in features I personally wanted, so I started working on my own.

When I explained this to my girlfriend, she asked, "Is this just a fancy way to talk to yourself?"

And I said, "No, it's to avoid talking to you."

I'm not sure if many people will find it useful on /r/selfhosted, but I thought I'd share it here as well.

Here is a complete overview of accent and a GitHub link. The source code is open, but it relies on paid API services.

It's still early in development, and I wanted to show it to the community and gather some feedback. There are many features I'm considering implementing, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it evolves based on user input.

I appreciate any thoughts on the project.
