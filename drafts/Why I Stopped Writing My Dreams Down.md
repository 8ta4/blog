Well, the usual way of writing down dreams wasn't cutting it for me. By the time I grab a pen, the dream details start getting fuzzy. So I started talking about my dreams out loud right when I wake up. This voice dream journaling method has been working like a dream for me. 

I've noticed:

- Talking is faster than writing. Every second counts when dream memories are fading quickly.

- Keeping your eyes closed helps maintain connection with the dream state. You're not confronted with your bedroom reality.

- Talking quietly is key. Your own voice can wake you up if too loud.

- You don't have to worry about making perfect sense. Large language models can help reconstruct the narrative later.

I put together [a video](https://youtu.be/Yemn1UAKx0M) to show you how this works.

If you've tried voice dream journaling, I'd love to hear about your experience. Do you have any tips to make it even better?
