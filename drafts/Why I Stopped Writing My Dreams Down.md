Lots of folks use dream journaling for lucid dreaming. Well, the usual way of writing down dreams wasn't cutting it for me. By the time I grab a pen, the dream details start getting fuzzy. So I started talking about my dreams out loud right when I wake up. This voice dream journaling method has been working like a dream for me. 

I've noticed:

- Talking is faster than writing. Every second counts when dream memories are fading quickly.

- Keeping your eyes closed helps maintain connection with the dream state. You're not confronted with your bedroom reality.

- Talking quietly is key. Your own voice can wake you up if too loud.

- You don't have to worry about making perfect sense. Large language models can help reconstruct the narrative later.

If you've tried voice dream journaling, I'd love to hear about your experience. Do you have any tips to make it even better?
