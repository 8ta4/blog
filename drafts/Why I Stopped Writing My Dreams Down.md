I wanted to share my dream journaling approach that's been working like a dream for me. The usual way of writing down dreams wasn't working great. By the time I grab a pen, the dream details start getting fuzzy. So I started talking about my dreams out loud right when I wake up.

I've noticed:

- Talking is faster than writing. Every second counts when dream memories are fading quickly.

- Keeping your eyes closed helps maintain connection with the dream state. You're not confronted with your bedroom reality.

- Talking quietly is key. Your own voice can wake you up if too loud.

- You don't have to worry about making perfect sense. Large language models can help reconstruct the narrative later.

Here's a video showing how this works:

The code for the voice capture setup I use is here:

If you've tried voice dream journaling, I'd love to hear about your experience. Do you have any tips to make it even better?
