I'm looking for a language-learning app that lets me have conversations in Chinese while showing me the transcript as I go.

Here's what I'm looking for:
- Lets me chat in Chinese
- Shows Chinese characters and Pinyin as I speak and as the app responds
- Uses a physical headset button to let the app know it's their turn instead of guessing when they're done talking
- Works on iOS
- Costs less than $1 per hour of conversation
- Can handle hour-long conversations with context
- Uses standard pronunciation
- Responds in under 10 seconds
- Keeps replies short and to the point
- Ends each response with a question

The idea is to practice Chinese while seeing the transcript and picking up new vocab. The perfect Chinese language learning app would be just like living in China. You [can't complain](https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dfd1iv/i_asked_my_chinese_friend_what_its_like_living_in/#:~:text=He%20says%20he-,can%27t%20complain,-.).

Have you come across anything like this?
