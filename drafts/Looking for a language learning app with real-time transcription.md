I'm trying to find a language learning app that lets me have conversations in Chinese while showing me the transcript as I go.

Here's what I'm looking for:
- Lets me chat in Chinese
- Shows Chinese characters and Pinyin as I speak and as the app responds
- Has simple playback controls without automatic silence detection
- Works on iOS
- Costs less than $1 per hour of conversation
- Can handle hour-long conversations with context
- Uses standard pronunciation
- Responds under 10 seconds
- Keeps replies short and to the point
- Ends each response with a question to keep the convo going

The idea is to practice Chinese while seeing the transcript and picking up new vocab. And instead of the app trying to guess when you're done talking, you'd just tap a button or use your headphones to let the app know it's their turn.

The perfect Chinese language learning app would be just like living in China. You [can't complain](https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dfd1iv/i_asked_my_chinese_friend_what_its_like_living_in/#:~:text=He%20says%20he-,can%27t%20complain,-.).

Have you come across anything like this?
