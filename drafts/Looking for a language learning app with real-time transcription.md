I'm trying to find a language learning app that lets me have real, natural conversations in Chinese while showing me the transcript as I go. Before I start building something myself, I wanted to see if anything like this already exists.

Here's what I'm looking for:
- Lets me chat naturally in Chinese
- Shows Chinese characters and Pinyin as I speak and as the app responds
- Has simple playback controls without automatic silence detection
- Works on iOS
- Costs less than $1 per hour of conversation
- Can handle hour-long conversations with context
- Uses standard pronunciation
- Responds under 10 seconds
- Keeps replies short and to the point
- Ends each response with a question to keep the convo going

The idea is to practice Chinese in a natural way while seeing the transcript and picking up new vocab. And instead of the app trying to guess when you're done talking, you'd just tap a button or use your headphones to let the AI know it's their turn.

The perfect Chinese language learning app would be just like living in China. You can't complain.

Have you come across anything like this? I'd love to hear if something like this already exists so I don't have to reinvent the wheel!
