Do you know any AI coding assistants that can handle Clojure?

Your suggestions are not just welcome, they're going to be put to the test. Live. On a real project involving Clojure, Python via libpython-clj, and Haskell. I'll be diving into your recommendations headfirst on a live stream.

I have used Phind for many projects while live streaming my coding adventures in Haskell, PureScript, and Bash, but now I'm curious to see what else is out there.

I'm looking for one that is as sharp as Linus Torvalds, ready to refine algorithms, boost performance, and helpfully email the original coder, "Your code is shit."

Just one little snag though. Docker and local GPU are off-limits.
