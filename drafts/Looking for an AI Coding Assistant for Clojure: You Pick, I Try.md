Do you know any AI coding assistants that can handle Clojure?

I'm looking for one that's got the chops of Linus Torvalds, ready to refine your algorithms, boost your system performance, and helpfully inform the original coder, "Your code is shit."

Your suggestions are not just welcome, they're going to be put to the test. Live. On a real project involving Clojure, Python via libpython-clj, and Haskell. I'll be diving into your recommendations headfirst on a live stream.

Just one little snag though. Docker and local GPU are off-limits.

I have used Phind for many projects, but now I'm curious to see what else is out there.
