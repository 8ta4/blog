Have you ever seen a tool that offers word-by-word precise feedback on your pronunciation for any sentence you want to practice?

When it comes to learning pronunciation, many of us rely on speech recognition systems to check how accurately we're speaking. Usually, if the system understands what you're saying, you get the green light and move on to the next sentence. It only tells you if you passed or failed.

What I'm envisioning with `accent` is a more detailed approach. Speech-to-text APIs often give word-level probabilities, showing how confident the system is in recognizing each word. A high probability means you nailed the pronunciation, while a low one suggests there's room for improvement. The idea behind `accent` is to use these probabilities to give more precise feedback.

I've put together some documentation for the tool. But before I jump into development, I want to make sure I'm not reinventing the wheel. If you know of any tools that do this, please let me know! I'd really appreciate any feedback or insights you have.

Some people might think a tool like this could be perpetuating linguistic discrimination. I might be called an accentist or even worse, racist, for developing such an app. At least I'm not being hypocritical about it. TV presenters often preach about racism and diversity in the same perfect, standard accent. Accents speak louder than words!
