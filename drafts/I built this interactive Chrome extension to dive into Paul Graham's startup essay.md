I'm a cereal entrepreneur, because I'm so broke I can only afford cereals. After a few failed attempts at building the next unicorn, I figured it was time to learn from the best. So I started studying Paul Graham's famous essay "How to Start a Startup."

But then I went one step further and built a Chrome extension called `quest`. It turns a web page into yes/no questions that reveal the answers directly in the original text. You can check your understanding immediately and hopefully avoid dozing off in the middle of a paragraph.

The first article I tested this on is Paul Graham's "How to Start a Startup." If you want to give `quest` a try:

1. Install `quest` from the Chrome Web Store: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/quest/pbgjongjakhehokeemfciihdpdlmgche

2. Open Paul Graham's essay with a special URL that includes a pointer to the YAML file: https://paulgraham.com/start.html?quest=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/8ta4/quests/e1ba866e7e1642bb456cf34b7c99fd9921fbd185/paulgraham.com/start.html/quest.yaml

3. Use your keyboard's right arrow to answer "yes," left arrow to answer "no," and down/up arrows to jump between questions. When you reveal an answer, it shows the exact text that answers that question.

The extension is open source, and you can find the GitHub repo here: https://github.com/8ta4/quest

I'd love to hear what you think. Any feedback on features is welcome.
