I'm in the middle of designing a Chrome extension that I've tentatively named `quest`. The big idea? To totally change the way we digest technical content by turning it into a Q&A journey. Think "Choose Your Own Adventure" book, but with questions instead of goblins and wizards. It's still early days, and I haven't started coding yet. But I do have a design rationale, which you can check out right [here](https://github.com/8ta4/quest/blob/main/docs/RATIONALE.md).

`quest` has some cool features:

- **Universality**: In theory, it can turn any content into questions using generative AI.
- **Non-Linear Reading**: Users can jump around sections while `quest` keeps track of where they've been.
- **Interactivity**: `Quest` pops up a question, hides the answer, and lets users test their understanding.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: You can navigate around just using keyboard shortcuts.

I underline every sentence in my book. With my Asperger's, they said I couldn't "read between the lines". It's this experience that inspired me to conceptualize `quest`, to help folks like me navigate the maze of technical content.

Before I dive deeper into this project, I could really use your insights:

1. If there are any similar tools out there already, I'd love to know so I don't reinvent the wheel.
2. Any feedback on the design or implementation would be super helpful. If there's a smarter way to reach my goal, I'm all ears.
