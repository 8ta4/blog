I'm looking for a language-learning app that lets me have conversations in Chinese while showing me the transcript as I go.

Here's what I'm looking for:

- Lets me speak in Chinese

- Shows Chinese characters and Pinyin as I speak and as the app responds

- Keeps replies short

- Ends each response with a question

- Uses a physical headset button to signal it's their turn instead of guessing when I'm done talking

- Can handle hour-long conversations without losing context

- Uses standard pronunciation

- Responds in under 10 seconds

- Costs less than $1 per hour of conversation

- Works on iOS

OpenAI's advanced voice mode is close but doesn't show Chinese characters and pinyin in real-time, has annoying silence detection instead of button controls, and is unreliable even with the $200/month plan.

The idea is to practice Chinese while seeing the transcript and picking up new vocab. It'd be so immersive, it'd feel like you're actually living in China. You [can't complain](https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dfd1iv/i_asked_my_chinese_friend_what_its_like_living_in/#:~:text=He%20says%20he-,can%27t%20complain,-.).

Have you come across anything like this?
