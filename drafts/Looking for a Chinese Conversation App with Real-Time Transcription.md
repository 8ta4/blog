I'm looking for a language-learning app that lets me have conversations in Chinese while showing me the transcript as I go.

Here's what I'm looking for:
- Lets me chat in Chinese
- Shows Chinese characters and Pinyin as I speak and as the app responds
- Keeps replies short and to the point
- Ends each response with a question
- Uses a physical headset button to signal it's their turn instead of guessing when I'm done talking
- Can handle hour-long conversations without losing context
- Uses standard pronunciation
- Responds in under 10 seconds
- Costs less than $1 per hour of conversation
- Works on iOS

The idea is to practice Chinese while seeing the transcript and picking up new vocab. The perfect Chinese language learning app would be just like living in China. You [can't complain](https://old.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dfd1iv/i_asked_my_chinese_friend_what_its_like_living_in/#:~:text=He%20says%20he-,can%27t%20complain,-.).

Have you come across anything like this?
