Have you ever seen a tool that offers word-by-word precise feedback on your pronunciation for any sentence you want to practice?

When it comes to learning pronunciation, speech recognition tech is the go-to for many. If it gets what you're saying, you're good to go. But it's a simple pass or fail.

What I'm envisioning is a more detailed approach. Speech-to-text APIs often give word-level probabilities, showing how confident the system is in recognizing each word. A high probability means you nailed the pronunciation, while a low one suggests there's room for improvement. The idea is to use these probabilities to give more precise feedback.

I've put together some [documentation](https://github.com/8ta4/accent) for the tool. But before I jump into development, I want to make sure I'm not reinventing the wheel. If you know of any tools that do this, please let me know! I'd really appreciate any feedback.

Some people might think a tool like this could be perpetuating linguistic discrimination. I might be called an accentist or even worse, racist, for developing such an app. At least I'm not being hypocritical about it. TV presenters often preach about racism and diversity in the same perfect, standard accent. Accents speak louder than words!
