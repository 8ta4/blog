I've been searching for a Chrome extension for about a year now, and I'm hoping someone here might know of something that fits what I need. I'm looking for an extension that can turn technical content into an interactive Q&A format, kind of like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.

Here's what I'm hoping this extension can do:

- Convert any technical content into a series of questions and answers.

- Allow for non-linear reading and track my progress.

- Keep answers hidden until I'm ready to see them.

- Let me navigate using only keyboard shortcuts like those Vim fans love.

- Work with both PDFs and web pages.

- Automatically save my progress.

- Offer undo/redo options.

Does any of this ring a bell? I'd prefer to use an existing tool if it's out there, but if not, I'm thinking of building it myself.

This all started about a year ago when I was slogging through a really dense document. My buddy walked by and was like, "Do you need someone to hold your hand while you read?" And I was like, "Nah, but I'd love someone to hold your mouth while I read."

When I couldn't find what I was looking for, I even started planning how to build it. I got as far as writing the documentation but never started the coding. Now that I might be able to pursue this idea, I figured I'd check one more time to see if something like this already exists before I go and reinvent the wheel.
