A couple of months ago, I embarked on a journey to find the perfect 24/7 speech-to-text transcription tool. Now, I've got a specific question that I'm hoping you can help with: **What's the ideal microphone for this task?** I'm all ears for feedback!

The biggest hurdle so far has been finding the right microphone. I have two main requirements: it needs to be **comfortable enough to wear all day** and **precise enough to isolate and transcribe my voice**. A wireless connection would be a bonus. Accuracy is key here, as it's important that the microphone can isolate my voice effectively. u/Economics-Regular suggested an ear bone microphone, which sounds fascinating. I've looked into it, but consumer-level ear bone mics seem to be few and far between, with most options being military-grade.

I've put more than a dozen microphones to the test, and the Poly Voyager 5200 came out on top. However, it's not without its flaws:

1. **Battery Life**: It only lasts for 7 hours.
1. **Noise**: It doesn't perform well in noisy environments.
1. **Connectivity**: There are occasional connectivity issues.
1. **Charging Port**: It uses an outdated USB mini port instead of USB-C.

Despite these issues, the Poly Voyager 5200 is the best I've found so far. But I'm convinced there's a better option out there.

In addition to finding the perfect microphone, I'm also looking into speaker verification. u/rdesh26 recommended the [pre-trained ECAPA-TDNN model from SpeechBrain](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb), which seems promising. This could help ensure that the transcriptions are indeed of my voice. However, I realize that this isn't a substitute for a high-quality microphone.

I've also made a proof of concept, which you can check out [here](https://github.com/8ta4/say). It's still very buggy, but it has potential.
