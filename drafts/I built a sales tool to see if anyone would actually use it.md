There's a stark contrast. Developer tools thrive in open source. Sales tools are almost exclusively closed-source SaaS.

This is likely for a few reasons:

- Sales tools are built for making money, not for the craft.

- The users are salespeople, not developers.

An open-source sales tool is probably a doomed idea.

So I built a CLI that generates outreach messages called [`spam`](https://github.com/8ta4/spam). It runs a tournament between language models to find the best draft.

I'm so sure it's dead on arrival that I haven't bothered adding a `LICENSE` file.

If you think I'm wrong, open a pull request with an MIT license. You'd be giving me a license to shill.
