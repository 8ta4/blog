Is there a shower-friendly, noise-canceling microphone out there that can accurately capture my speech while I'm in the shower?

I have [this project](https://github.com/8ta4/say) where I want to transcribe everything I say, 24/7. I want to analyze my speech patterns, word choices, emotions, and more. I want to quantify myself through my voice.

But there's a problem: I can't find a good microphone that can handle the shower.

I've previously asked for advice on subreddits like r/HeadphoneAdvice (https://old.reddit.com/r/HeadphoneAdvice/comments/18pfkgu/looking_for_a_headset_that_can_handle_247/) and r/speechrecognition (https://old.reddit.com/r/speechrecognition/comments/186bk2q/looking_for_the_ideal_microphone_for_247/) before. Back then I was hunting for a noise-canceling mic for outdoor use. But no one seemed to care. Maybe they just didn't get it.

But you guys get it. You're the quantified self community.

I've tried a few devices, but none of them work well with water. Here's what I've tested so far:

- [Bose SoundLink Micro Bluetooth Speaker](https://www.bose.com/p/speakers/bose-soundlink-micro-bluetooth-speaker/SLMC-SPEAKERWIRELESS.html): It picks up voice, but the moment you hit the shower, the transcription accuracy nosedives because it doesn't filter out the noise.
- [OpenRun](https://shokz.com/products/openrun): The mic quality leaves a lot to be desired, especially when it's wet. It has an IP67 rating, but if you soak it in water, the sound quality drops and the transcription becomes gibberish.
- [Voyager 5200](https://www.poly.com/us/en/products/headsets/voyager/voyager-5200): It's not exactly waterproof (IPX4 rating), but I gave it a whirl in a mock shower setup (no direct water contact). The results were encouraging. It managed to separate my voice from the background noise well, hinting that the right waterproof mic could do the trick.

I also gave [Krisp](https://krisp.ai/), a noise-canceling software, a shot, hoping it would boost transcription accuracy. Here's the scoop:

- With the Bose and OpenRun, it didn't help because transcription was still useless.
- For the Voyager 5200, Krisp actually made the transcription worse.

The real challenge is to find a mic that can:
- Withstand the shower environment
- Transcribe accurately even when it's wet or noisy.

Then I had this brilliant idea: quit showering. It saves time and money. People leave me alone.

But then I realized I can't stop showering because I got this genius idea in the shower.
