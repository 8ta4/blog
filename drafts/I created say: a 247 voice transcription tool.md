Hi!

I've been working on software that transcribes your voice 24/7, and I've been using it myself for the past couple of months. There were multiple similar platforms like this, but I found them lacking in features I personally wanted, so I started working on my own.

When I explained this to my girlfriend, she asked, "Is your memory getting even worse?" And I said, "Must be, since I don't remember asking for your opinion."

I'm not sure if many people will find it useful on /r/selfhosted, but I thought I'd share it here as well.

Here is a complete overview of [say](https://github.com/8ta4/say/blob/e7fa58ba0bb330fc576892d925f1d316920e37c6/README.md#usage) and [a GitHub link](https://github.com/8ta4/say). The source code is open, but it relies on a paid API.

It's still early in development, and I wanted to show it to the community and gather some feedback. There are many features I'm considering implementing, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it evolves based on user input.

Now, you might be thinking, "Wait a minute, this post structure looks familiar..." I recently [posted](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1eeo860/i_created_accent_a_pronunciation_practice_platform) about another app using the same style as [the LinguaCafe announcement](https://old.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1aqpv49/linguacafe_a_reading_software_for_language). It worked well, and u/LinguaCafe even [encouraged it](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1eeo860/i_created_accent_a_pronunciation_practice_platform/lfj7q8m/)! So here I am, a shameless one-trick pony.
