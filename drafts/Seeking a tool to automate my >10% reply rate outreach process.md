I need help solving a problem that's causing burnout.

My manual cold outreach process gets a >10% reply rate, but it's so time-consuming that I burn out before 100 sends. I've blueprinted a solution that requires two capabilities.

First, a scraper. The approach is a CLI tool communicating with a companion browser extension via native messaging. This makes requests appear as real human activity.

Second, a multi-stage pipeline to automate my judgment calls. It works in three steps:

1. An agent generates multiple drafts. A separate agent, acting as the prospect and blind to my internal goals, evaluates them to find the most persuasive one. This process loops until the output can't be improved.

1. The winning draft is passed to another agent for a single pass to check facts and fix formatting, while preserving the substance.

1. A final agent reviews the polished draft and makes a strategic call, outputting one of `go`, `defer`, or `disqualify`.

I know this blueprint is a Rube Goldberg machine, and I've fallen in love with a technical problem.

The sane business decision is to hire a VA. But if a tool like this existed, I'd use it over making a human do this burnout-inducing task. A pipeline cost of up to $1 per outreach is fine for the few thousand prospects I'm targeting, as LLM costs trend down.

This post looks like a "problem validation" in disguise. This would be a terrible business. The market for a system this obsessive is minuscule. I usually open-source my projects, and that's the likely path if I have to build this myself.

So, does any tool enable this kind of obsessive refinement for sales copy? I'm not looking for this exact blueprint, but a platform with a similar philosophy. I need to make sure I'm not reinventing the wheel before I start chasing this pipeline dream.
