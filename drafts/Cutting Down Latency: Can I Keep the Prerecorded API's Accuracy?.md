I'm working on an open-source project called `say`, which transcribes voice 24/7.

How can I slash latency big time but still keep the accuracy of the prerecorded API intact?

Here's what I'm aiming for:
- Accuracy: I want to match the accuracy of the prerecorded API.
- Latency: My goal is to achieve sub-second latency.
- Budget: Given that this is an open-source project, the solution needs to be cost-effective.

The streaming API doesn't quite hit the mark in terms of accuracy. And I suspect that the TCP slow start might be the culprit behind the latency issues with the prerecorded API. For reference, I'm using Opus with a 24kbps bitrate and a gigabit connection in the continental US.

Here are a couple of potential solutions I've thought of:
- Hybrid API: Deepgram could potentially offer an API that allows for real-time audio streaming to be temporarily stored and then processed using the prerecorded API once the streaming is complete. This could bypass the initial upload delay and maintain high accuracy.
- On-Premise Hosting: Deepgram could offer a cost-effective on-premise hosting solution to improve latency.

I realize that these solutions might require significant development on Deepgram's part. So, I'm open to any suggestions or alternative strategies.
