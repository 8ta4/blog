I'm working on [a project](https://github.com/8ta4/reddit) that aims to track relevant Reddit discussions in real-time. I'm hoping to get some insights from you all.

Here's the situation: I got some feedback from u/EndlessHiway that made me rethink my approach. They [suggested](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1eutath/i_built_a_free_opensource_locally_hosted_tool_to/limwjvl/) just doing a Google search, and when I [explained](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1eutath/i_built_a_free_opensource_locally_hosted_tool_to/liohlb3/) how my idea is different, their response was, "[So you don't know how to use a search engine is what you're saying.](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1eutath/i_built_a_free_opensource_locally_hosted_tool_to/lipf2x5/)"

I wanted to fire back with, "So you don't know how to use a brain is what you're saying."

But it got me thinking. There might be advanced search engine techniques I'm not aware of. So, I'm turning to r/datascience to see if there's a better way to achieve what I'm trying to do.

Here's where I'm at: Traditional search engines seem to fall short for this particular task, and here's why:

- Intent Recognition: Standard searches rely too much on keywords and might miss when someone is indirectly asking for help. I need to be able to understand the intent behind social media interactions, especially when someone is looking for assistance.

- Customization: I want to start with examples of relevant content and then find more content like that. This feels more precise than what search engines usually offer in terms of personalization.

- Real-Time Monitoring: Ideally, I'd love to get instant alerts when someone posts something relevant, so I don't have to keep checking for new content manually.

So, my question to the community is: What's the best way to achieve these goals? Specifically, I'm looking for methods that can:

- Understand and recognize user intent

- Customize search results based on specific examples of content

- Provide real-time monitoring and alerts
