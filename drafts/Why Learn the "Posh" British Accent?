I've been thinking about making a video on learning what's often called the "posh" British accent, technically known as Received Pronunciation (RP). But before I do, I'd love to hear your thoughts. To start the conversation, I'll share some insights from my experience using [my open-source tool](https://github.com/8ta4/accent) that I developed to work on RP. Whether you're actively working on this accent, considering it, or just curious about it, your ideas are welcome. I've put together a list of reasons why someone might want to learn RP. If you can think of any other potential benefits, I'm all ears!

- Comedy: [They say travel broadens the mind except with Americans. It tends to widen the arse.](https://youtu.be/wwQS2YZhQ40?t=357) With RP, you'll nail Jimmy Carr's deadpan delivery.

- Party Trick: Be the life of the party! Switch accents mid-conversation and watch your friends question their sobriety.

- Role-Play: Bond like James Bond. Spice up your love life with some 007 roleplay.

- Film Criticism: It's a buzzkill. You're now qualified to ruin movies for everyone by nitpicking. "That's not how a Brit would say 'water bottle'!"

- Native Speakers: It's the secret to perceived nativeness. The world's awash with American accents, making imposters easy to spot.

- Bullshit Detectors: Bust them all. "YouTube pronunciation gurus" don't know what they're talking about.

- Politeness: You'll be queueing for fun. With RP, you're always sorry, even when you're not.

- Political Correctness: Imagine a white dude attempting an Indian accent. Cue the cancel culture! "How dare you mock a minority!" cry the PC police. Never mind that Indian English speakers could fill the UK a few times over.

- Status Symbol: Forget trophy wives. Your Hollywood dialect coach is the ultimate accessory.

- Passive Aggression: Channel your inner Mary Berry. "I do admire their bravery in sending this out of the kitchen."

- Correction: Patronize Americans. When they accuse you of patronizing them, simply say, "[That's pronounced pah-tro-nizing.](https://youtu.be/wwQS2YZhQ40?t=380)"

- Understandability: Save everyone from the dreaded "What?" RP is easier for both humans and machines to understand.

- Language Learning: It's the gateway drug. With RP, you're not learning English, you're learning how to learn languages. Your mouth will be ready for any language even if your brain isn't.

- Resources: Brits make the best dictionaries. In the world of Oxford and Cambridge, RP is the VIP, and American English barely made the guest list. If I had a pound for every RP resource, I'd be morbidly obese.

- Simplicity: Drop your R's. Embrace the art of lazy pronunciation!

- Acting: Lights, camera, accent! Learning RP can open up more opportunities.

- English Teaching: Non-native teachers, rejoice! Now you too can benefit from those racist hiring practices and watch your paycheck grow.

- Prestige: RP gives you 10 IQ points. Watch as colleagues suddenly find your ideas brilliant. It's a better career boost than that English degree gathering dust in your drawer.

- Late-Night Talk Show: Give the writers a break. [Discussing your accent can be a lighthearted way to fill airtime](https://youtu.be/0GgHhOqUrUw?t=131).

- Somnologist: Become a somnologist. Cure insomnia with your phonetic trivia sessions.

- Mindfulness: Wherever you go, there you speak. Turn your accent training sessions into tongue yoga classes. As you meticulously shape each sound, worldly concerns fade away.

- Bullying: The accent is mightier than the sword! Blend in at British schools and avoid the dreaded "Oi, Yankee!" battle cry.

- Wrong Numbers: Bye-bye, telemarketers! You can pretend to be someone else, claiming a wrong number with a convincing accent.

- Escape Plan: You've just been kidnapped by anti-American terrorists. Your spot-on British accent is better than any hostage negotiator.

- Identity Theft: Hide from the feds in style. Nothing says "new you" like a crisp British accent.

- Reunion: Bring your divorced parents together. All you need to do is discover your long-lost British twin and [switch places](https://youtu.be/PMAhVpgzmRU?t=43).

I'm reposting the original content here in r/EnglishLearning to maintain a record and continue the discussion.

As the comments on the original post showed and as [Wikipedia notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation#:~:text=For%20over%20a%20century%2C%20there%20has%20been%20argument%20over%20such%20questions%20as%20the%20definition%20of%20RP%2C%20whether%20it%20is%20geographically%20neutral%2C%20how%20many%20speakers%20there%20are%2C%20the%20nature%20and%20classification%20of%20its%20sub%2Dvarieties%2C%20how%20appropriate%20a%20choice%20it%20is%20as%20a%20standard%2C%20and%20how%20the%20accent%20has%20changed%20over%20time.), people have been arguing over the definition and evolution of RP for over a century.

So here's another reason to learn RP: you'll have a surefire way to push some people's buttons!
