`say` is an app I've been working on. It allows you to:

- Record your thoughts, ideas, and conversations 24/7 without pressing any buttons
- Access your transcriptions easily with a keyboard shortcut
- Use Claude separately to organize up to a week of transcription into clear, coherent, and structured text

You can install it on your Mac by following the instructions in the GitHub repository:

You'll need a Deepgram account for the transcription API, but no separate account is needed for `say`. Deepgram offers a $200 free credit, which should last months even with heavy use.

I'd love to hear your feedback!

This post was inspired by a popular post I saw recently about RambleFix here on the subreddit. Their transcription app, which launched around the same time as mine, is now pulling in over $2,000 in monthly recurring revenue, while mine is still at $0. I figured I might learn something by taking a page out of their book. In fact, I used their year-old launch post as a template for this one. To describe this approach, I invented a new word: plagiarism.
