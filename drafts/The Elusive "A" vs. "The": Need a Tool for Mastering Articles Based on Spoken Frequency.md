Is there a resource that can help nail down articles and noun forms based on the most frequently spoken words?

Let me tell you why I'm diving deep into articles and noun forms. While working on [my always-on transcription tool](https://github.com/8ta4/say), I noticed that speaking in standard English reduces errors in transcription. Plus, my tool's hooked up with [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/), which calls out my grammatical errors. It's through this integration that I've become more aware of the errors I make. So, I figure if I can nail down my article and noun usage, I'll improve my transcriptions. They say content words matter more than function words, but as a Grammar Nazi, I'll tell you: all words matter.

If there's already a method that works, I want to use it. And even if a resource doesn't check all the boxes but does some things well, I'm down to see how it could fit into a bigger solution I might put together.

Here's what I am looking for in a resource:

- Goal: To use the correct articles (definite, indefinite, or no article) and form of nouns (singular, plural) with 95% accuracy when speaking English.

- Approach: Cover 95% of the most frequently spoken nouns or noun meanings to achieve the goal.

- Data Source: Prefer spoken frequency data, but written frequency data can be used as a substitute if spoken data is not available.

- Data Format:

  - Noun, sorted by spoken frequency.

  - Test:

    - Phrase or sentence with the article and noun hidden for a fill-in-the-blank style question.

    - Keep determiners (like "some", "my", and "which") to a minimum in the test phrases, since they can mess with assessing if you understand countable and uncountable nouns. But determiners can be included if they're part of set expressions.

    - Minimize the use of adverbs and adjectives unless part of set expressions.

    - Short phrases are preferred over full sentences.

    - Basic, commonly understood verbs and nouns that get the point across.

  - Answer: The correct form of the noun and article to be filled in.

  - Explanation:

    - Identify the specific meaning of the noun used in the test.

    - Outline the grammatical rule determining the correct article and noun form.

    - Note if it is part of a set expression.

- Data Format Example:

  - Noun: time

  - Test: I lived in New York for ___.

  - Answer: a time

  - Explanation:

    - "Time" in this context refers to a phase, making "time" singular.

    - "For a time" is a set expression.

- Licensing: Open source or permissible for any purpose, including commercial use.

There are tons of resources that talk about this stuff, but these resources don't cut it for me.

- ['A' and 'The' Explained](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/21237488): It does a great job explaining the general principles of article usage, but it doesn't have that list of words covering 95% of spoken language.

- [Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/):

  - Fill-in-the-Blank: It's got examples, but not in that fill-in-the-blank style.

  - Explanation: While it does tell you if a noun is countable or uncountable, it often lists multiple options without guidelines on when to use which one.

  - Determiners: Examples often have determiners like "some".

  - Modifiers: A lot of the examples are complex, with extra adjectives or adverbs.

  - Licensing: Using their data is a gray area, even if it's for educational purposes.
