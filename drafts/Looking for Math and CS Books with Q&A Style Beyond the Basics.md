Don't you hate it when CS and math textbooks drop P vs NP and say, "the proof is left as an exercise for the reader"?

But hey, not all textbooks are like that. I love books that teach me CS and math through a Q&A dialogue, like the ones by the Schemers ("The Little Schemer", "The Seasoned Schemer" etc.), "Quick Calculus", "Abstract Algebra: A Student-Friendly Approach", and Stroud's "Engineering Mathematics" and "Advanced Engineering Mathematics". These books are great because they give you instant feedback and make you feel like a Jedi master.

But here's the catch - I'm looking for more. I want to dive into advanced topics with this same Q&A style. Where can you find books that use this teaching method?
