Looking for Math and CS Books with Q&A Style Beyond the Basics

I love math and CS books that ask me questions and then answer them. Like the Schemer series ("The Little Schemer", "The Seasoned Schemer" etc.), "Quick Calculus", "Engineering Mathematics", "Advanced Engineering Mathematics", and "Abstract Algebra: A Student-Friendly Approach". These books are great because they let you learn at your own pace, give you instant feedback, and make you feel like a Jedi master. But what if you want to go beyond the basics and explore more advanced topics? Where can you find books that use this awesome teaching method?

If you have any suggestions for books that use this Q&A style for higher-level math and CS, please share them with me.
