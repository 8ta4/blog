I have a demo!

Here's what the tool does:

- Tracks changes made to system or app preferences.
- Generates `PlistBuddy` commands.

With this, you can script your macOS setup and recreate your environment on new machines.

Now, I know what you're thinking, but let me assure you, I absolutely do not have OCD. If I had a penny for every time someone suggested it, I'd have exactly 1,526 pennies.

Installation and usage instructions are on GitHub. Let me know if you have feedback or ideas!
