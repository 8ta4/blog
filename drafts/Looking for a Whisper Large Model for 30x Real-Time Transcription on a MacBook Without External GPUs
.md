I'm working on a project where I need to transcribe 30 seconds of audio in less than a second. I mentioned some challenges with running Whisper locally, and u/Enough-Meringue4745 responded, "Please research before you spout excuses ðŸ˜‚". So, here I am, doing my research.

Specifically, I'm looking for a Whisper model that:

- Processes audio at least 30 times faster than real-time.

- Uses the large version of Whisper for better accuracy.

- Can run locally on a MacBook without relying on external GPUs.

I know someone might be thinking, "Do you always ask the Internet to do your thinking for you?" And to that, I'd say, "Yeah, just like you always ask your imaginary friends!"

For more context about my project, you can check out the documentation here:

- End-user documentation

- Developer documentation

I'd really appreciate any insights, suggestions, or pointers to relevant resources. Thanks!
