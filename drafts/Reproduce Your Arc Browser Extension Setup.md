[My extension tool](https://github.com/8ta4/extension) now supports the Arc browser, thanks to an awesome contribution from one of our very own community members, u/oschrenk!

Some users have [mentioned](https://old.reddit.com/r/ArcBrowser/comments/1ciztua/arc_sync_doesnt_sync_extensions_or_profiles) that Arc doesn't sync extensions between devices. This is where my tool comes in handy. It allows you to automate your Arc setup in a declarative manner. Instead of manually installing and configuring your extensions every time, you can create a script that defines your ideal setup.

u/oschrenk faced the classic challenge of setting up the project with incomplete documentation. But after pushing through, they managed to submit [a pull request](https://github.com/8ta4/extension/pull/32) that added Arc support. Their journey had a nice arc... right up until I spoiled it with this dreadful pun!
