Hey Mac folks! I wanted to share some updates about [`say`](https://github.com/8ta4/say), the voice transcription tool that runs in the background on your Mac.

One concern that came up was about the tool [picking up other people's voices](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1efk5a7/i_created_say_a_247_voice_transcription_tool/lfm82ew). So, I've tweaked the hideaway feature.

In your hideaways, locations where you feel comfortable using your Mac's built-in microphone, `say` operates normally. But when you're not in one of those spots, it automatically switches to an external mic. Ideally, you'd use a headset with noise-canceling. This way, `say` isn't gonna catch what other people are saying, which keeps their privacy intact.

If you're still worried about privacy, you can always stick to good old pen and paper. I guess the customers always write!

Now, I got a lot of requests for [Linux](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1efk5a7/i_created_say_a_247_voice_transcription_tool/lfoaty1) or [Windows](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1efk5a7/i_created_say_a_247_voice_transcription_tool/lflrfem) versions. But I'm focusing on making it the best it can be for us Mac users. That's actually why I'm posting here on r/MacApps.

I'd love for you to give it a shot. If you do try it out, let me know what you think. Are there any other features you'd like to see?
