Hey Mac folks! I wanted to share some updates about [`say`](https://github.com/8ta4/say), the voice transcription tool that runs in the background on your Mac.

Some folks were worried about it [picking up other people's voices](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1efk5a7/i_created_say_a_247_voice_transcription_tool/lfm82ew), so I made some tweaks to the hideaway feature. When you're in one of your trusted locations, it uses your Mac's built-in mic. If not, it switches to an external mic. Ideally, you'd use a noise-canceling headset to avoid picking up background chatter.

If you're still worried about privacy, you can always stick to good old pen and paper. I guess the customers always write!

For those asking about [Linux](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1efk5a7/i_created_say_a_247_voice_transcription_tool/lfoaty1) or [Windows](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1efk5a7/i_created_say_a_247_voice_transcription_tool/lflrfem) versions, sorry, but I'm focusing on us Mac users for now. That's actually why I'm posting here on r/MacApps.

I'd love for you to give it a shot. Let me know what you think. Are there any other features you'd like to see?
