I'm currently in the planning phase of developing a tool that records and transcribes voice 24/7. The goal is to capture thoughts and ideas anytime they occur and transcribe them into a searchable text format. This tool would use voice activity detection (VAD) to cut down on unnecessary usage and would organize transcripts in a specific directory structure. The transcriptions would be accessible and editable by the user.

Before I dive into coding, I wanted to check if there are any existing solutions out there that already solve this problem. I'm mainly interested in tools or services that can handle continuous recording and transcription. Also, a solution that provides high accuracy in transcription and has good voice activity detection would be ideal.

If you are aware of any such tools or services, I would greatly appreciate your recommendations. I'm also open to hearing about your experiences with any similar solutions.
