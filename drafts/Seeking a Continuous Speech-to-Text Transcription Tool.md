I am looking for a tool that can continuously record and transcribe my voice 24/7, essentially replacing traditional dictation methods. Ideally, I want it to automatically start and stop recording without manual intervention.

The requirements for this tool are as follows:

1. It should offer local transcription, but I am open to cloud-based solutions if they offer better accuracy, latency, or maintenance.
2. It should be able to identify and transcribe only my voice, ignoring others. If this is not possible, I can ensure no other voices are present to avoid data contamination.
3. I should be able to access the transcriptions using my computer, but I don't want my computer to be the recording device as it is not always on.
4. I want the tool to segment my transcript so that I can quickly copy relevant segments. If I switch topics while speaking, the transcript should be segmented accordingly.
5. The tool should work even in the presence of noise.
6. The tool should be very accurate, ideally state-of-the-art or near human level.
7. The tool should have low latency, ideally less than 1 second.

The transcriptions will be used for various purposes:

- **Drafting Content:** The primary purpose is to draft messages, emails, social posts, documents, etc.

- **LLM Feedback:** Another potential use case is to feed my daily thoughts into a Language Model (LLM) for insights and practical suggestions, such as software recommendations, tips, etc.

- **Auto-Completion:** In the long term, I would like the LLM to query my past transcripts to predict and auto-complete what I'm going to say, possibly at a paragraph or whole message level.

While I am aware of the privacy implications of such a tool, it will be located in my home, minimizing concerns about others' privacy.
