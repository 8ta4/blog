Is there a TTS (Text-to-Speech) API out there that outshines OpenAI's TTS AI in terms of quality, latency, and cost?

I have some specific criteria:

1. Quality

   The most important aspect is how natural the generated speech sounds. For pronunciation practice, the naturalness of the speech are paramount.

   OpenAI's TTS AI has been excellent in this regard, providing clear and consistent word articulation.

   While Eleven Labs offers highly emotive speech, it comes at a higher cost and isn't necessarily better for pronunciation practice.

   I don't rely on quality scores for TTS APIs; the proof is in putting the words together.

1. Latency

   OpenAI's TTS API typically processes a sentence in about 0.5 seconds, which is decent but could be improved.

1. Cost

   I want to keep my total monthly cost under $100.

   I prefer a pay-as-you-go model instead of a fixed-cost one with a usage cap. Big providers like Amazon Polly, Google, and Microsoft Azure offer this, as does OpenAI.

   For my pronunciation practice, I expect to use it for up to 30 hours a month. I use Deepgram for speech-to-text, which costs $0.0043 per minute and requires two API calls per pronunciation. Here's a quick cost breakdown:

   - Deepgram costs: 30 hours × 60 minutes/hour × 2 calls × $0.0043 per minute ≈ $15.48

   - Remaining budget for TTS: $100 - $15.48 = $84.52

So, I'm looking for a TTS API that outperforms OpenAI's in at least one of these areas while matching it in the others.
