I've recently developed a tool that automates the installation and configuration of Chrome extensions on macOS. While I'm proud of this tool, my main intention in this post is not to promote it, but to offer help to those who might benefit from such automation.

If you're someone who already has scripts to configure macOS but not Chrome, I'd be more than happy to assist you in extending your automation to Chrome extensions. 

For instance, let's say you frequently use the [Video Speed Controller](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk) extension on Chrome and you want to automate its installation and configuration. You can use this command:

```sh
extension install chrome nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk config.js
```

The `config.js` file should contain JavaScript code that sets the `audioBoolean` to `true`, enabling the `Work on audio` feature:

```javascript
chrome.storage.sync.set({ audioBoolean: true });
```

If you're unsure about writing the JavaScript code for your `config.js` file, I can help you with that. The `extension` tool has a listen mode which generates JavaScript code based on changes it detects. 

If you provide me with a list of your extensions and a screenshot of your extension settings, I can help create an installation script and a matching configuration script. 

Please note that currently, the `extension` tool only supports macOS and is available via Homebrew:

```sh
brew install 8ta4/extension/extension
```

I'm looking forward to helping you streamline your Chrome extension setup process. Don't hesitate to reach out with your extension list and configuration preferences!
