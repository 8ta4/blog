Check out the demo!

Here's what this tool does:

- Installs and configures browser extensions on Chrome with a single command.

- Supports JavaScript-based configuration files to set custom preferences.

With `extension`, you can script your browser environment to install and customize the exact extensions you need.

It's built for Chrome, but by extension, it also works with Edge and Arc since they're Chromium-based. (No pun extended.)

Setup and usage instructions are on GitHub. It's free, open-source, and currently for macOS only. Let me know if you have feedback or ideas!
