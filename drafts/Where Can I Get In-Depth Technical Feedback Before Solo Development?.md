In my last app, I went through several iterations using different language stacks.

1. v0.1.5: [Clojure](https://github.com/8ta4/say/blob/v0.1.5/clj/src/clj/core.clj)
2. v0.5.0: [PureScript](https://github.com/8ta4/say/blob/v0.5.0/src/Main.purs)
3. v0.8.1: [ClojureScript](https://github.com/8ta4/say/blob/v0.8.1/src/main.cljs)

I could have avoided switching stacks midway if I'd talked to experienced developers before jumping into the code. Working alone makes it even more challenging.

Now, I'm working on a new app and I've spent time thinking through and [documenting the problem](https://github.com/8ta4/accent/blob/c97d9ec4255778a46154612a0d0ec707defbd97c/DONTREADME.md) before writing any code. I'd love to share my approach and get some feedback to improve it. Catching potential issues early is key because, as they say, the early nerd catches the bug!

But finding an online community where I can dive into deep discussions about what to build and how to build it has been tough. If you know of any good ones, please share! If you have suggestions on where to find such communities, please let me know. Any tips would be appreciated!
