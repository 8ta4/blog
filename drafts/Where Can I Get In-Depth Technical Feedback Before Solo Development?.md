Have you found specific communities that offer the in-depth technical discussions needed for solo development?

I've spent time thinking through and documenting the problem before writing any code. I'd like to share my approach and get suggestions for improvement. Identifying potential issues early on is crucial because, as they say, the early nerd catches the bug!

However, finding a community for in-depth discussions on what to build and how to build it has been challenging. If you have suggestions on where to find such communities, please let me know. Any tips would be appreciated!
