I'm thinking of building [a command-line tool](https://github.com/8ta4/pun) that generates puns based on text input. There are plenty of pun generators out there, but I've got some reasons for making yet another one:

- Most pun generators I've seen are web-based. But, for my workflow, a simple CLI tool is just faster.

- Some tools generate puns based on obscure terms. I'm aiming for things people would generally understand and hopefully find at least mildly amusing.

- Context is King or Queen. Most existing tools I've found don't really generate puns that are relevant to the specific text you give them.

It's early stage, and I want to make sure I'm not duplicating some random GitHub repo that's already nailed this. Are there any features you'd want in a tool like this? I'd love to get your take on the concept.
