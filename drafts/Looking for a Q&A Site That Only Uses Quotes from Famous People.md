Do you know a site where you can ask questions and get answers only in the form of quotes from famous people?

I don't like the existing sites because:

- Stack Exchange: Too factual, not enough opinions

- Quora: Too much self-promotion

What I want is a site that has these features:

- Every answer is a direct quote from someone notable (people who have their own Wikipedia page)

- Every quote has a source (book title and page number, or article link with text highlight)

- Users can vote on answers

I'm going to post a question on this site: "How do I pronounce Shia LaBeouf's last name?" I bet the answer will be "Just Do It."

Is there such a site out there?
