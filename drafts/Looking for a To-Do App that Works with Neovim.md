Has anyone discovered a to-do app that seamlessly integrates Neovim text editing and offers comprehensive task management features?

I wrote this question about finding the perfect to-do app months ago. The first task on my yet-to-be-discovered perfect app should have been, "Remember to post your question about finding the perfect to-do app."

Here's what I'm looking for:

- A Mac app
- Neovim text editing
- Ergonomic keybinding for non-text editing tasks
- Local file storage for offline access
- Recurring tasks that auto-reschedule when marked done
- Due dates and start dates
- A keyboard-navigable calendar view
- Multi-line notes for each task
- Keyboard-only operation
- Low latency

I've tried a few popular tools, but they just didn't cut it:

- Todoist: No Neovim keybinding and no local file storage
- Joplin: No Neovim keybinding
- Taskwarrior: No multi-line notes and recurring tasks spawn new tasks
- Emacs Org-mode: Too many keystrokes and occasional performance hiccups
- Neovim Org-mode: Even more sluggish performance
- Todo.txt: No ergonomic keybinding for non-text editing tasks

I've also dabbled with embedding or integrating editors:

- Firenvim: Textarea doesn't expand as I type, so I have to scroll a lot. Sometimes it messes up the HTML elements. And it keeps the focus after editing, which breaks Vimium navigation.
- GhostText: It requires me to manually switch to Neovim every time I select a textarea.

If you know of a tool that fits the bill or comes close, I'd love to hear about it! üôè
