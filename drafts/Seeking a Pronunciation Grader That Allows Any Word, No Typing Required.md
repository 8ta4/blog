Do you know of a tool that can grade my pronunciation of any spoken word without needing to type?

Here's the backstory: I developed [a transcription tool](https://github.com/8ta4/say) that runs 24/7, and I've integrated it with [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) to highlight grammatical mistakes. But I've noticed that non-standard pronunciations often throw off the transcriptions. That's what got me thinking about ways to fix my pronunciation.

I want to focus on how I pronounce individual words, avoiding complications like assimilation that happen in phrases or sentences.

The dream scenario would be having a native speaker as a friend with benefits. If I nail it, she'll go, "Just like that!"

But let's be real, having someone like that around 24/7 isn't realistic. So, I'm looking for a digital alternative.

Here's what I'm looking for in this app:

- Web-Based: Requires no installation

- Accent Support: Lets me choose a specific accent, like Received Pronunciation, for the evaluation

- Word Flexibility: Lets me practice any word I want, not just a set list

- Multi-Word Feedback: Can evaluate an unlimited sequence of words, identifying where one word ends and the next begins, through pauses or keystrokes

- Low Latency: Evaluates my pronunciation with minimal latency like under a second after each word

- Scoring: Gives me a score of how close I am to the right pronunciation

- User Playback: Lets me listen to how I said the word

- Reference Playback: Lets me listen to a reference pronunciation to compare

- IPA Transcription: Shows the IPA symbols of how I pronounced the word

- Heteronym Support: Counts it right if I'm close to any of the acceptable ways to say it

I've tried a couple of things so far, but they didn't quite do the trick:

- [Elsa Speak](https://elsaspeak.com): Makes me use a fixed lesson plan without letting me choose words

- [Pronounce](https://www.getpronounce.com):

   - Makes me type in words manually

   - Can be buggy, especially with British English

   - Doesn't give me a score of how close I am to the ideal pronunciation

I'm using English as an example, but this could work for any language.

If you have any suggestions, let me know!
