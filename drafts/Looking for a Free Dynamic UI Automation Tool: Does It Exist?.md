Do you know of any tool or project that can automate the UI interaction of an app that changes frequently and also costs nothing?

I got curious about this when I had to deal with Apple Maps. [Someone asked](https://github.com/8ta4/plist/issues/24#issuecomment-1931474720) how to automate Apple Maps settings using plist. My first reaction was, "Why not just use Google Maps?" But then I realized that might be a classic XY problem, so I jumped to Z: "Forget Maps. Just get lost."

That made me think more about the limitations of plist management. It led me to consider the possibility of venturing into UI automation. Imagine being able to automate any setting, not just for Apple Maps but for any app, without relying on plist files or default commands.

Here are my requirements:

- Dynamic UI Adaptation: The tool should be able to navigate and interact with software whose UI might change over time due to app or OS updates.
- Zero Cost: The tool should be either free, using maybe a venture capital model where the initial user cost is subsidized, or, if the tool runs locally, it should work on a recent Mac's base model.

Why This Matters:

This is not just about tweaking settings. Generic AI-driven automation would let the user teach the AI how to do something, and then repeat it a hundred times.

Are there any existing tools that meet these requirements?
