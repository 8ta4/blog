I'm a programmer with ADHD... well, probably. The doctor tried to explain it to me, but I wasn't paying attention.

I've always struggled with organizing my thoughts and staying on track. I started using Claude to help me make sense of my verbalized stream of consciousness, and it's been a game-changer for my productivity.

Since I know how to code, I've developed a free app. It's an always-on tool that transcribes everything you say, allowing you to capture your ADHD thoughts at any time. You can copy up to a week's worth of transcriptions with one command. Then, you can paste these transcriptions into Claude. It's great for capturing ideas or creating to-do lists from scattered thoughts.

I'd love for some of you to try it out and let me know what you think. You can find more info here. What features would you like to see added? I'm super open to constructive criticism. Thanks!
