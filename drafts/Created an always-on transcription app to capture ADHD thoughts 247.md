I'm a programmer with ADHD... well, probably. The doctor tried to explain it to me, but I wasn't paying attention.

I've always struggled with organizing my thoughts and staying on track. I started using [Claude](https://claude.ai) to help me make sense of my verbalized stream of consciousness, and it's been a game-changer for my productivity.

Since I know how to code, I've developed a free app. It's an always-on tool that transcribes everything you say, allowing you to capture your ADHD thoughts anytime. You can copy up to a week's transcriptions with one command. Then, you can paste these transcriptions into Claude. It's great for capturing ideas or creating to-do lists from scattered thoughts.

I'd love for some of you to try it out and let me know what you think. You can find more info [here](https://github.com/8ta4/say). What features would you like to see added? I'm super open to constructive criticism. Thanks!
