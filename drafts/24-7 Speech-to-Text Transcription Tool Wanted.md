I'm on the hunt for a tool that can record and transcribe my voice 24/7. For years, scientists worked tirelessly to give humans the gift of eternal memory. Now, every time I forget my anniversary, it's clearly on purpose.

## How I'll Use It

Here are some ways I plan to use the transcriptions:

- **Drafting Content:** Mainly, I'll use it to draft messages, emails, social posts, documents - you name it!
- **LLM Feedback:** Another idea is to feed my daily thoughts into a Language Model (LLM) for insights and practical suggestions.
- **Auto-Completion:** In the long run, I'd love for the LLM to look at my past transcripts and auto-complete what I'm about to say.

## What I'm Looking For

Here's what I need in this tool:

- **Accuracy:** It should catch every word I say, almost as good as a human would.
- **Speed:** It should be quick on its feet - ideally, less than a second's delay.
- **Noise Resistance:** A little background noise shouldn't throw it off.
- **Budget:** I'm hoping to keep it under $100/month. But hey, if it boosts my productivity, I might be willing to stretch that a bit.
- **Storage:** I'd love to keep the transcriptions forever, and the recordings too if it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. No need for the silent bits though. If it could sync up with Dropbox or something similar, that would be super convenient.
- **Security:** If it uses cloud storage, top-notch security measures like encryption are a must.
- **Segmentation:** It would be great if it could break up my transcript into manageable chunks. That way, if I switch topics mid-sentence, each topic gets its own segment.
- **Integration:** It would be awesome if it could work with macOS, Neovim, and Alacritty for drafting text. Something like a Neovim plugin or macOS clipboard integration would be really handy.
- **Format:** A simple text file with timestamps would do the trick. But hey, the more options, the merrier!
- **Local Transcription:** I'd prefer if it could transcribe locally, but I'm open to cloud-based solutions if they're more accurate or easier to maintain.
- **Accessibility:** I should be able to access the transcriptions from my computer. But my computer should not be the recording device.
- **Hardware:** Something stationary would work best. Maybe an old mobile phone or a Raspberry Pi. If there's wearable tech that can last all day and gives clearer recordings and more accurate transcriptions, I'm all for it!
- **Voice Recognition:** Ideally, it should only pick up my voice and ignore everyone else's. But if that's not possible, I can make sure no one else is around when I'm using it.
- **Offline Use:** An offline mode would be a nice bonus. But since I'll mostly be using this at home, it's not a deal-breaker.

I know there are some privacy concerns with this kind of tool. But since it'll be in my home, I'm not too worried about invading anyone else's privacy.
