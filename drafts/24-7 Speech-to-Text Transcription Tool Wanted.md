I am seeking a tool that can record and transcribe my voice 24/7, replacing traditional dictation methods. Ideally, it should start and stop recording automatically.

## Requirements

The tool should meet the following requirements:

- **Accuracy:** The tool should be highly accurate, ideally state-of-the-art or near human level.
- **Low Latency:** The tool should have low latency, ideally less than 1 second.
- **Noise Resistance:** The tool should work in noisy environments.
- **Budget:** I expect the cost to be less than $100/month as a productivity tool. However, I am willing to be flexible if the cost is justified by increased productivity.
- **Storage:** I would like to keep transcriptions indefinitely and recordings if affordable. Silent parts of recordings are not necessary. Automatic local availability through Dropbox or another syncing service is preferred.
- **Security:** If cloud storage is included, strong security measures including encryption are essential.
- **Segmentation:** The tool should segment my transcript so that I can easily copy relevant segments. If I switch topics while speaking, the transcript should be segmented accordingly.
- **Integration:** Integration with macOS, Neovim, and Alacritty for drafting text would be ideal. A Neovim plugin or macOS clipboard integration would be appreciated.
- **Format:** A raw text file with timestamps would be versatile. One primary format is sufficient, but more options are welcome.
- **Local Transcription:** Local transcription is preferred, but cloud-based solutions are acceptable if they offer better accuracy, latency, or maintenance.
- **Accessibility:** I should be able to access the transcriptions using my computer, but my computer should not be the recording device.
- **Hardware:** A stationary device would be ideal. An old mobile phone or Raspberry Pi would work well. Wearable tech is acceptable if the battery lasts at least a day and it improves recording clarity and transcription accuracy.
- **Voice Recognition:** The tool should recognize and transcribe only my voice, ignoring others. If this is not possible, I can ensure no other voices are present.
- **Offline Use:** An offline mode would be nice to have, but it is not essential as I will primarily use this tool at home.

## Use Cases

The transcriptions will be used for various purposes:

- **Drafting Content:** The primary purpose is to draft messages, emails, social posts, documents, etc.
- **LLM Feedback:** Another potential use case is to feed my daily thoughts into a Language Model (LLM) for insights and practical suggestions.
- **Auto-Completion:** In the long term, I would like the LLM to query my past transcripts to predict and auto-complete what I'm going to say.

While I am aware of the privacy implications of such a tool, it will be located in my home, minimizing concerns about others' privacy.
