An open source approach to remotely record everything you say on your Apple Silicon computer.
Note: Relies on Apple Silicon, and configured to only produce Apple Silicon builds.

I think the idea of recording everything you say has the potential to change how we interact with our computers, and believe it should be open source.

Also, from a privacy / security perspective, this is like... pretty scary stuff, and I want the code open so we know for certain that everything is leaving your laptop. It's like exposure therapy: if it hurts, do it more often.
