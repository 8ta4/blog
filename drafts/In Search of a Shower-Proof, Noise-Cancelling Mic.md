Is there a shower-friendly, noise-canceling microphone out there that can accurately capture my speech while I'm in the shower?

I want to transcribe my every word, all day, every day. I've previously asked for advice on subreddits like r/HeadphoneAdvice and r/speechrecognition, but back then I was hunting for a noise-canceling mic for outdoor use.

I've tried a few devices, but none of them work well with water.

Here's the rundown of my trials:

- Bose Soundlink Micro Bluetooth Speaker: It picks up voice, but the moment you hit the shower, the transcription accuracy nosedives because it doesn't filter out the noise.
- OpenRun: The mic quality leaves a lot to be desired, especially when it's wet. It has an IP67 rating, but if you soak it in water, the sound quality drops and the transcription becomes gibberish.
- Poly Voyager 5200: It's not exactly waterproof (IPX4 rating), but I gave it a whirl in a mock shower setup (no direct water contact). The results were encouraging. It managed to separate my voice from the background noise pretty well, hinting that the right waterproof mic could do the trick.

The real challenge is to find a mic that can:
- Withstand the shower environment
- Transcribe accurately even when it's wet or noisy.

Then I had this brilliant idea: quit showering. It saves time and money. People leave me alone.

But then I realized I canâ€™t stop showering because I got this genius idea in the shower.
