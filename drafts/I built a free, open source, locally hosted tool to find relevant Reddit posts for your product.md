The open source tool indexes Reddit posts based on their content and similarity to your product's use case, making it easy to find relevant discussions. Mark example posts and get notified about new similar ones to engage with potential customers.

The backend is built using these great open source components:

- [all-mpnet-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2): A model for producing text embeddings

- [sentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers): A Python library for text embeddings

- [libpython-clj](https://github.com/clj-python/libpython-clj): A library for calling Python from Clojure

- [devenv](https://github.com/cachix/devenv): A development environment tool

After seeing how well [the meme search engine post](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1e3x6l0/i_built_a_free_open_source_locally_hosted_search/) did, I asked, "[Can I copy your homework?](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/can-i-copy-your-homework)" It said, "Yeah, just change it up a bit so it doesn't look obvious you copied."
