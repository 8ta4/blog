Feedback wanted: a pun-generation algorithm, pre-coding stage

They say puns are the lowest form of humor. When I say I'm building a tool to automatically generate puns, they make pun of me!

My goal is straightforward: create word-swapping puns that are relevant to the input and easy to understood. This isn't about making a general joke machine.

Let me walk through a quick example. Say I wanted to create puns for this Reddit post:

1. Relevant Word Identification: Based on cosine similarity between input text and each word in the vocabulary, words like "pun", "phonetic", or "similarity" might pop up as relevant.

2. Phonetic Similarity Analysis: "pun" would match as phonetically similar to "fun" using Levenshtein distance between IPA representations.

3. Substitution: The phrase "make fun of" exists in the vocabulary. "Fun" gets replaced with "pun", resulting in "make pun of".

Are there any major flaws I'm missing? I haven't built a single line of code yet. I'm looking for feedback before diving in.
