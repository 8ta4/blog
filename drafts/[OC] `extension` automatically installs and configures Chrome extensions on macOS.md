I cooked up this tool called [`extension`](https://github.com/8ta4/extension). It's like dot files for Chrome and Edge on macOS. The idea came from a nightmare scenario: imagine losing access to both your computer and Google account simultaneously. Poof! There goes your entire Chrome setup. And let me tell you, my Chrome wasn't built in a day! I'd love to get some user feedback on it.
