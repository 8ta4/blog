Hey Mac folks! I wanted to share some updates about `say`, the voice transcription tool that runs in the background on your Mac.

One concern that came up was about the tool picking up other people's voices. So, I've tweaked the hideaway feature.

In your hideaways, locations where you feel comfortable using your Mac's built-in microphone, `say` operates normally. But when you're not in one of those spots, it automatically switches to an external mic. Ideally, you'd use a headset with noise-canceling. This way, `say` isn't gonna catch what other people are saying, which keeps their privacy intact.

If you're still worried about privacy, you can always stick to good old pen and paper. I guess the customers always write!

Now, I got a lot of requests for Linux or Windows versions. But I'm focusing on making it the best it can be for us Mac users. That's actually why I'm posting here in the Mac apps subreddit.

I'd love for you to give it a shot. If you do try it out, let me know what you think. Are there any other features you'd like to see?
