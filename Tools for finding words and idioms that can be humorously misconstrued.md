I am looking for tools or libraries that can help me identify words and idioms that can be intentionally misconstrued to mean something else, resulting in humor. Here's an example from a [video clip](https://youtu.be/bKmadR4Ye54?t=419) with a transcript:

```
CONAN:
There's this movie coming out.

COURTNEY:
Yes.

CONAN:
Title undetermined at this point.

COURTNEY:
Chairman of the Board.

CONAN:
Oh, all right. Do something with that, you freak.

NORM:
I bet the board is spelled B-O-R-E-D.
```

In this example, the word "board" is humorously misunderstood as "bored." I am interested in finding tools that can help me generate similar misunderstandings for words and idioms.

I have tried searching for existing tools but haven't found any that specifically address this problem. Are there any existing tools, libraries, or techniques that can help me achieve this? I am open to suggestions for any programming language or platform.
