Hi everyone! I'm working on a tool that can monitor and notify me of relevant social media comments related to a specific product. I want to use machine learning techniques to filter out the noise and find the most useful feedback.

I have an idea of using Sentence Transformers to generate embeddings for the comments and then use cosine similarity to find the most relevant ones. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach or if there are any drawbacks or challenges with it. Transformers are like my ex: all they need is attention and your money - but mostly your money. So I want to make sure I'm using them wisely and effectively.

Do you have any advice or suggestions on how to approach this problem using Sentence Transformers? Or do you know of any other methods or tools that might be better suited for this task? I would really appreciate any input or guidance you can offer. Thank you very much!

I have also documented my ideas and progress on GitHub, in case you want to check it out or collaborate with me. Here is the link: https://github.com/8ta4/reddit
