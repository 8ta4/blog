I'm developing a tool that monitors and notifies users of relevant social media comments related to a specific product. It's the perfect tool for founders to innovate, marketers to connect, and trolls to... well, troll. You can check out my GitHub repository for more details: https://github.com/8ta4/reddit. The tool uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to find and notify users of similar Reddit posts.
I'm looking for some advice and feedback from the Hacker News community on how to improve and extend this tool. Right now, it's still in the planning stage, but I'm aiming to make it work for Reddit first. But I'm thinking of adding support for other platforms such as Hacker News in the future. How can I effectively implement this feature, or are there any existing tools or approaches that can help me with this task? I'd appreciate any insights or suggestions you can offer.

Please review the documentation in the GitHub repository and let me know what you think. Thank you!
