I often run `chezmoi status` and discover that some files managed by Chezmoi have been altered. The issue is, I don't always know what caused these changes or when they were made.

Who is messing with my `~`? Who is gaslighting me chez moi?

I need to find out the truth. I need to get notifications whenever a file changes, so I can catch the culprit and confront them. I'm thinking of using `fswatch`. But maybe there's a better way.

Do you know of any feature in Chezmoi that can help me with this? Or any community solution that has worked for you?
